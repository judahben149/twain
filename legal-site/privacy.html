    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="effective-date"><strong>Effective date:</strong> January 24, 2026</p>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Overview</h2>
      <p>Twain (the “App”) is built and operated by an individual developer. This Privacy Policy explains how personal data—including account information, user-generated content, precise location data, push notification identifiers, and related metadata—is collected, used, and shared when you use the App.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect the following categories of information to provide and improve the App:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account information:</strong> Email address, authentication identifiers, and related account settings used to sign in through Supabase.</li>
        <li><strong>Partner connection data:</strong> Details needed to pair and maintain links between connected partner accounts, including relationship status and shared preferences.</li>
        <li><strong>User-generated content:</strong> Sticky notes, shared board entries, wallpaper selections, and other materials you create or upload within the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Precise location data:</strong> Location information collected when you enable location sharing while the App is in use. Location data is stored in Supabase and displayed only to your connected partner as part of the shared experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Push notification data:</strong> Device push tokens (such as APNs or FCM tokens) and delivery metadata related to notifications triggered by partner actions, wallpaper changes, new notes, or other in-app events.</li>
        <li><strong>Device and app information:</strong> Device model, operating system version, app version, language, time zone, and diagnostic data that help ensure the App functions properly across devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics and crash information:</strong> Aggregated usage trends, performance metrics, and crash reports used to understand how the App performs and to resolve issues.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide the App’s functionality, including partner pairing, shared boards, sticky notes, wallpaper syncing, and other shared features.</li>
        <li>Enable precise location sharing between connected partners when you grant permission.</li>
        <li>Send push notifications about relevant partner actions and in-app events.</li>
        <li>Manage subscriptions and entitlements through RevenueCat, including verifying purchases and delivering Twain Plus features.</li>
        <li>Protect the security of the App, prevent abuse, and enforce policies.</li>
        <li>Improve, troubleshoot, and optimize the App’s performance and reliability.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Location Sharing</h2>
      <p>Precise location sharing is an optional feature provided to help partners stay informed about each other’s whereabouts. When location sharing is enabled, your location is collected while the App is in use and shown to your connected partner. You can disable location sharing at any time through in-app controls or by revoking location permissions in your device settings. Only connect with partners you trust and consider your personal safety when sharing location information.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Push Notifications</h2>
      <p>The App may send push notifications about actions such as a partner updating wallpaper, posting a new note, or other shared events. Receiving notifications is optional, and you can disable them through your device settings at any time. Push tokens are used solely for delivering notifications via Apple Push Notification service (APNs) and Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
      <p>We share information as needed for the App to function:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>With your connected partner:</strong> Shared boards, sticky notes, wallpaper selections, and precise location data are visible to the partner linked to your account.</li>
        <li><strong>With service providers:</strong> Supabase stores and manages authentication, database, and file storage. RevenueCat manages subscription purchases and entitlements.</li>
        <li><strong>With platform services:</strong> Apple App Store and Google Play facilitate purchases and subscription management. Apple and Google notification services (APNs and FCM) deliver push notifications.</li>
        <li><strong>With Unsplash:</strong> Wallpapers are displayed using Unsplash images, and basic request metadata may be processed according to Unsplash’s policies.</li>
        <li><strong>For legal compliance:</strong> Information may be disclosed if required by law, regulation, or legal process, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of users or others.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
