# Twain 💜

Twain is a shared app for couples to stay connected through small, meaningful moments.

From synced wallpapers to sweet notes, shared memories, and location sharing, Twain gives couples a simple space to feel closer even when they’re apart.

## What Twain does

Twain focuses on lightweight, thoughtful interactions between partners:

- **Wallpaper Sync**  
  Set a wallpaper once and sync it instantly with your partner’s phone.

- **Wallpaper Rotation (Plus)**  
  Create folders of wallpapers that rotate automatically over time.

- **Sticky Notes**  
  Leave short, sweet messages your partner can see anytime.

- **Shared Board**  
  Save photos and moments you both care about in one shared space.

- **Location Sharing**  
  Share your location with your partner to feel connected throughout the day.

- **Notifications**  
  Get notified when your partner sends a note, updates a wallpaper, or shares something new.

Twain is designed to be calm, personal, and intentional, not another noisy chat app.
